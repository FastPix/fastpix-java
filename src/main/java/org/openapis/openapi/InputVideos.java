     * Create media from URL
     * 
     * <p>This endpoint allows developers or users to create a new video or audio media in FastPix using a
     * publicly accessible URL. FastPix fetches the media from the provided URL, processes it, and stores
     * it on the platform for use.
     * 
     * <p>#### Public URL requirement:
     * 
     * <p>The provided URL must be publicly accessible and must point to a video stored in one of the
     * following supported formats: .m4v, .ogv, .mpeg, .mov, .3gp, .f4v, .rm, .ts, .wtv, .avi, .mp4, .wmv,
     * .webm, .mts, .vob, .mxf, asf, m2ts
     * 
     * <p>#### Supported storage types:
     * 
     * <p>The URL can originate from various cloud storage services or content delivery networks (CDNs) such
     * as:
     * 
     * <p>* **Amazon S3:** URLs from Amazon's Simple Storage Service.
     * 
     * <p>* **Google Cloud Storage:** URLs from Google Cloud's storage solution.
     * 
     * <p>* **Azure Blob Storage:** URLs from Microsoft's Azure storage.
     * 
     * <p>* **Public CDNs:** URLs from public content delivery networks that host video files.
     * 
     * <p>Upon successful creation, the API returns an `id` that must be retained for future operations
     * related to this media.
     * 
     * <p>#### How it works
     * 
     * <p>1. Send a POST request to this endpoint with the media URL (typically a video or audio file) and
     * optional media settings.
     * 
     * <p>2. FastPix uploads the video from the provided URL to its storage.
     * 
     * <p>3. Receive a response containing the unique id for the newly created media item.
     * 
     * <p>4. Use the id in subsequent API calls, such as checking the status of the media with the <a
     * href="https://docs.fastpix.io/reference/get-media">Get Media by ID</a> endpoint to determine when
     * the media is ready for playback.
     * 
     * <p>FastPix uses webhooks to tell your application about things that happen in the background, outside
     * of the API regular request flow. For instance, after the media file is created (but not yet
     * processed or encoded), FastPix sends a `POST` request to your specified webhook URL with the event
     * <a href="https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/media-events#videomediacreated">video.media.created</a>.
     * 
     * <p>After processing completes, monitor the events <a
     * href="https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/media-events#videomediaready">video.media.ready</a> and <a
     * href="https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/media-events#videomediafailed">video.media.failed</a> to track
     * the status of the media file.
     *
