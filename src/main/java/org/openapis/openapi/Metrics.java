     * 
     * <p>#### How it works
     * 
     * <p>1. Before using this endpoint, you can call the <a
     * href="https://docs.fastpix.io/reference/list_dimensions">List Dimensions</a> endpoint to retrieve
     * all available dimensions that can be used in your query.
     * 
     * <p>2. Send a `GET` request to this endpoint with the required `metricId` and other query parameters.
     * 
     * <p>3. You receive a response containing the breakdown values for the specified metric, grouped and
     * filtered according to your parameters.
     * 
     * <p>4. Upon successful retrieval, the response includes the breakdown values based on the specified
     * parameters. Note that the time values ( `totalWatchTime` and `totalPlayingTime` ) are in
     * milliseconds
     * 
     * <p>#### Example
     * 
     * <p>A developer wants to analyze how watch time varies across different device types. By calling this
     * endpoint for the `playing_time` metric and filtering by `device_type`, they can understand how
     * engagement differs between mobile, desktop, and tablet users. This data guides optimization efforts
     * for different platforms.
     * 
     * <p>#### Key fields in response
     * 
     * <p>* **views:** The count of views based based on the applied filters.
     * 
     * <p>* **value:** The specific metric value calculated based on the applied filters.
     * * **totalWatchTime:** Total time watched across all views, represented in milliseconds.
     * 
     * <p>* **totalPlayTime:** Total time spent playing the video, represented in milliseconds.

     * 
     * <p>#### Key fields in response
     * 
     * <p>* **value:** The specific metric value calculated based on the applied filters.
     * * **type:** The data unit or format type (for example, "number", "milliseconds", "percentage").
     * * **name:** The display name of the metric (for example, "Views", "Overall Score").
     * * **metric:** The metric field represents the name of the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) being
     * tracked or analyzed. It identifies a specific measurable aspect of the video playback experience,
     * such as buffering time, video start failure rate, or playback quality.
     * * **items:** Nested breakdown of related metrics for more detailed analysis.
     * * **measurement:** Defines the aggregation type (for example, "avg", "sum", "median", "95th").

     * <p>#### How it works
     * 
     * <p>1. Before making a request to this endpoint, call the <a
     * href="https://docs.fastpix.io/reference/list_dimensions">list dimensions</a> endpoint to obtain all
     * available dimensions that can be used for comparison.
     * 
     * <p>2. Send a `GET` request to this endpoint with the desired metrics specified in the query parameters.
     * 
     * <p>3. You Receive a response containing the comparison values for the specified metrics across the
     * selected dimensions.

     * @param timespan This parameter specifies the time span between which the video views list must be retrieved by. You can provide either from and to unix epoch timestamps or time duration. The scope of duration is between 60 minutes to 30 days.
     *         
     *         **Accepted formats are:**
     *         
     *         array of epoch timestamps for example 
     *         `timespan[]=1498867200&amp;timespan[]=1498953600`
     *         
     *         duration string for example 
     *         `timespan[]=24:hours` or `timespan[]=7:days`
     *         
     * @param filterby Pass the dimensions and their corresponding values you want to filter the views by. For excluding the values in the filter we can pass "!" before the filter value. The list of filters can be obtained from list of dimensions endpoint.
     *         Example Values : [ browser_name:Chrome , os_name:macOS , !device_name:Galaxy ]
     *         
     * @param dimension The dimension id in which the views are watched.
     *         
     * @param value The value for the selected dimension. 
     *         For example:
     *          If `dimension` is `browser_name`, the value could be  `Chrome` `,` `Firefox` `etc` .
     *          If `dimension` is `os_name`, the value could be `macOS` `,` `Windows` `etc` .
     *         
     * @param options additional options
     * @return The response from the API call
     * @throws RuntimeException subclass if the API call fails
