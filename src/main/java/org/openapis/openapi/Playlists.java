     * Create a new playlist
     * 
     * <p>This endpoint creates a new playlist within a specified workspace. A playlist acts as a container
     * for organizing media items either manually or based on filters and metadata. <br> <br>
     * ### Playlists can be created in two modes
     * - **Manual:** Creates an empty playlist without any initial media items. Use this mode for manual
     * curation, where you add items later in a user-defined sequence.
     * - **Smart:** Auto-populates the playlist at creation time based on the filter criteria (for example,
     * a video creation date range) that you provide in the request.
     * 
     * <p>For more details, see <a href="https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/create-and-manage-playlist">Create and
     * manage playlist</a>.
     * 
     * <p>#### How it works
     * 
     * <p>- When you send a `POST` request to this endpoint, FastPix creates a playlist and returns a playlist
     * ID, using which items can be added later in a user-defined sequence.
     * - You can create a smart playlist that is auto-populated based on the metadata in the request body.
     * 
     * <p>#### Example
     * An e-learning platform creates a new playlist titled Beginner Python Series through the API. The
     * response returns a unique playlist ID. The platform uses this ID to add a series of video tutorials
     * to the playlist in a defined order.

     * <p>The playlist appears on the frontend as a structured learning path for learners.
