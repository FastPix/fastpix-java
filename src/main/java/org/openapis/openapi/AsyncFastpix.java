/**
 * FASTPIX API'S: FastPix provides a comprehensive set of APIs that enable developers to manage both
 * **on-demand media (video/audio)** and **live streaming experiences**, with built-in security
 * features through **cryptographic signing keys**. These APIs cover the full lifecycle of content
 * creation, management, distribution, playback, and secure access, making them ideal for building
 * scalable video-first applications.
 * ### Media APIs (Video &amp; Audio on Demand)
 * The **Media APIs** allow developers to create, retrieve, update, and delete media files, as well as
 * manage metadata, playback settings, and additional tracks such as audio or subtitles. With these
 * endpoints, developers can:
 * - Upload videos directly or create media from URLs. - Manage playback permissions and configure
 * playback IDs. - Add multilingual audio or subtitle tracks for global audiences.
 * 
 * <p>- Build robust video-on-demand (VOD) and audio-on-demand (AOD) libraries.
 * **Use case scenarios**   - **Video-on-Demand Platforms:** Manage large content libraries for
 * streaming services. - **E-Learning Solutions:** Upload and organize lecture videos, metadata, and
 * playback settings. - **Multilingual Content Delivery:** Add multiple language tracks or subtitles to
 * serve global users.
 * ### Live Stream APIs
 * The **Live Stream APIs** simplify the process of creating, managing, and distributing live content.
 * Developers can initiate broadcasts, configure stream settings, and extend streams to external
 * platforms through simulcasting. These endpoints also support real-time interaction and customization
 * of live events.
 * - Start and manage live broadcasts programmatically. - Control stream metadata, privacy, and
 * playback options. - Simulcast to platforms like YouTube, Facebook, or Twitch.
 * 
 * <p>- Update stream details and manage live playback IDs in real time.
 * **Use case scenarios**   - **Event Broadcasting:** Enable organizers to set up live streams for
 * conferences, concerts, or webinars. - **Creator Platforms:** Provide streamers with tools for
 * broadcasting gameplay, tutorials, or vlogs with simulcasting support. - **Corporate Streaming:**
 * Deliver secure internal town halls or meetings with privacy and playback controls.
 * ### Video Data APIs
 * The **Video Data APIs** Provide insights into viewer interactions, performance metrics, and playback
 * errors to optimize content delivery and user experience.
 * 
 * <p>- Track video views, unique viewers, and engagement metrics
 * - Identify top-performing content and usage patterns
 * - Break down data by browser, device, or geography
 * - Detect playback errors and performance issues
 * - Enable data-driven content strategy decisions
 * 
 * <p>**Use case scenarios**
 * - Analytics Dashboards: Monitor performance across content libraries
 * - Quality Monitoring: Diagnose and resolve playback issues
 * - Content Strategy Optimization: Identify high-value content
 * - User Behavior Insights: Understand audience interactions
 * 
 * <p>### Signing Keys
 * FastPix also provides endpoints for managing **cryptographic signing keys**, which are essential for
 * securely signing and verifying tokens, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). These keys are critical for
 * authenticating and authorizing API requests, as well as for protecting access to media assets.
 * - **Private key:** Used to create digital signatures (kept secret). - **Public key:** Used to verify
 * digital signatures (shared for verification).
 * By rotating and managing signing keys regularly, developers can maintain strong security practices
 * and prevent unauthorized access.
 * **Use case scenarios**   - **Token-based authentication:** Validate user access to premium or
 * subscription-based content. - **Key rotation:** Regularly rotate keys to reduce risk of compromise.
 * - **Protect intellectual property:** Prevent unauthorized distribution of valuable media assets.
 * 
 * <p>- **Control usage:** Restrict access to specific users, groups, or contexts. - **Prevent
 * tampering:** Ensure requested assets have not been modified. - **Time-bound access:** Enable signed
 * URLs with expiration for controlled viewing windows.
