     * Update user-agent restrictions for a playback ID
     * 
     * <p>This endpoint allows updating user-agent restrictions for a specific playback ID associated with a
     * media asset.
     * It can be used to allow or deny specific user-agents during playback request evaluation.
     * 
     * <p>**How it works:**
     * 1. Make a `PATCH` request to this endpoint with your desired user-agent access configuration.
     * 2. Specify a default policy (`allow` or `deny`) and provide specific `allow` or `deny` lists.
     * 3. Use this to restrict access to specific browsers, devices, or bots.
     * 
     * <p>**Example:**
     * A developer may configure a playback ID to deny access from known scraping user-agents while
     * allowing all others by default.
     * 
     * @param mediaId 
     * @param playbackId 
     * @param body 
     * @param options additional options
     * @return The response from the API call
     * @throws RuntimeException subclass if the API call fails
