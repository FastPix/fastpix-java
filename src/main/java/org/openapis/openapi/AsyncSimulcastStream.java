     * Create a simulcast
     * 
     * <p>Creates a simulcast for a parent live stream. Simulcasting allows you to broadcast a live stream to
     * multiple social platforms simultaneously (for example, YouTube, Facebook, or Twitch). This helps
     * expand your audience reach across platforms.
     * 
     * <p>A simulcast can only be created when the parent live stream is in the idle state (not currently live
     * or disabled). Only one simulcast target can be created per API call.
     * #### How it works
     * 
     * <p>1. Change to: When you call this endpoint, provide the parent `streamId` along with the simulcast
     * target details (such as platform and credentials). The API returns a unique `simulcastId`, which you
     * can use to manage the simulcast later.
     * 
     * <p>2. To notify your application about the status of simulcast related events check for the <a
     * href="https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/webhooks-collection#simulcast-target-events">webhooks for
     * simulcast</a> target events.
     * 
     * <p>#### Example
     * An event manager sets up a live stream for a virtual conference and wants to simulcast the stream on
     * YouTube and Facebook Live. They first create the primary live stream in FastPix, ensuring it's in
     * the idle state. Then, they use the API to create a simulcast target for YouTube.
