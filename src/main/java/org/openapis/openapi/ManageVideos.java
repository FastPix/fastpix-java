     * 
     * <p>#### How it works
     * 
     * <p>1. Send a DELETE request to this endpoint, replacing `{mediaId}` with the media ID, and `{trackId}`
     * with the ID of the track you want to remove.
     * 
     * <p>2. The track gets deleted from the media file, and you must receive a confirmation response.
     * 
     * <p>#### Webhook events
     * 
     * <p>1. After successfully deleting a track, your system must receive the webhook event
     * **video.media.track.deleted**.
     * 
     * <p>2. Once the media file is updated to reflect the track removal, a <a
     * href="https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/media-events#videomediaupdated">video.media.updated</a> event
     * must be triggered.
     * 
     * <p>#### Example
     * Suppose you uploaded an audio track in Italian for a video but later realize it's incorrect or no
     * longer needed. By calling this API, you can remove the specific track while keeping the rest of the
     * media file unchanged. This is useful when:
     * 
     * <p>- A track was mistakenly added and needs to be removed.
     * - The content owner requests the removal of a specific subtitle or audio track.
     * - A new version of the track gets uploaded to replace the existing one.
     *

     * tracks</a>, <a href="https://docs.fastpix.io/docs/manage-audio-tracks">Add own audio tracks</a>
     * 
     * @param mediaId The unique identifier assigned to the media when created. The value must be a valid UUID.
